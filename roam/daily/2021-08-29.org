* Started watching [[file:~/Videos/System Crafters/Learning Emacs Lisp/#5 - Reading and Writing Buffers in Practice.mkv][Reading and Writing Buffers in Practice]] yesterday
only got to =21:09= in the video though.
* found a way to make nowebs look nicer in shell mode
put it in a block above the desired block
* I would like exwm to be able to restart emacs with out exiting the xsession.
It dosen't look like this is possible from exwm so i'm going to try hacking the shell evironment to see if it's possible
* watched some more learing emacs lisp
got to =46:47=.
* Started moving Guix sub trees into drawrs
it looks much nicer
* also started moving header invocatins to there own box as well
it's gonna be rad
