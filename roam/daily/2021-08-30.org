* I'd like to setup auto login for my user with a mimimal graphical environment.
right now that seems to be a bit difficult. Complex. As far as i can tell Guix wasn't designed(source) with startx in mind. There is a function for it in the GUIX API but i don't know how tricky it'll be to implement.

First place to start would be with loging in our user automatically.
