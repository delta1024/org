* Started work on dotcrafter-guix
I'm a huge fan of how dotcrafter has made it easier to manage my
dotfiles. Upon learning i could get property tag info i tried to hack
it so it would noweb-ref it to a file. It didn't work. The solution is
to create an extention to dotcrafter that allows us to buid a manifest
for a package by specifiying the package name in an org property
header.
