* Upgraded emacs and system profiles
Couldn't get around to upgrading the user profile though
* Started configuring polybar
I integrated polybar into my exwm conifg
* The transparency hurts my eyes after long sessions of using emacs
Why don't we write a function to toggle the frame opacity of emacs on a button press. we can set the alpha values to 100.
* Update on frame transparncy
It apears to be more difficult the I antisipated, lets write a function to kill then spawn. I currently have picom configured to start in my .xsessions file and I like that behavior so i'm goin go keep it.
